Welcome to my Github Profile!

My name is Chandrahaas, and I'm a recent graduate from the University of California, Riverside with a B.S. in Business Adminstration + a concentration in Information Systems. I'm really interested in leveraging data to provide evdince for actionable insights, and translating that to progress within an organization, communities, or groups who want to build a better, sustainable future.
